### Gomez Gallery

This project was primarily an exercise in creating a website using C# and a MVC framework. 

This was done with a website for photos of my cat that contains both pagination as well as categories for easier location of specific images

Additionally, I used both Bootstrap 5 and jQuery in order to make a responsive webite including a fully seperate admin panel that you need to be logged in to access

While the SQL file for the database dump was too large to upload to github, it can be provided upon request
